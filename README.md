# Wellcome to BookLibraryHeaven! :book::bookmark:

BookHeavenLibrary is a great web application developed using Angular that allows you to easily find, filter and download relevant books from our rich library. The application communicates with a server built on ASP.NET Core using REST APIs, and works through JWT tokens to keep your data secure.

# Features:

## :hourglass: Search and filter books
You can use the powerful search tool to quickly find books that interest you. You also have the ability to apply filters to refine your search results.

## :lock: Authentication and security
Authentication is required to access some features of the app, such as downloading books and saving personal settings. We use JWT tokens to keep your data secure and prevent unauthorised access.




## :technologist:	Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## :copyright:Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## :construction_worker:	Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

## :rocket: Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## :rocket: Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via a platform of your choice. To use this command, you need to first add a package that implements end-to-end testing capabilities.
